                        Yosemite Valley, nestled in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, was formed millions 
                        of years ago through a combination of geological processes, including glaciation, which carved 
                        out its iconic cliffs and waterfalls. The Ahwahneechee people, a Native American tribe, lived 
                        in the valley for centuries before European settlers arrived. In 1851, the Mariposa Battalion, 
                        a group of European-American explorers, were the first non-Native Americans to document the valley,
                        leading to increased interest and tourism. Yosemite Valley was officially protected as a state park
                        in 1864, thanks to the efforts of naturalist John Muir and others, eventually becoming a 
                        cornerstone of the U.S. National Park System when Yosemite National Park was established in 1890.
